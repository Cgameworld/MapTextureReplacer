Map Texture Replacer allows you to easily replace grass, dirt and cliff map textures in your game.

The mod is intended to be used with map texture packs, currently, to find them search PDXMods for Map Texture Replacer. 

Features include:
- Dropdowns to easily change packs or individual textures
- Persistent settings between game loads
- Texture tiling adjustments
- Replacement of individual textures with any jpg/png from your computer
- Map editor support

This mod takes advantage of the fact that map textures are stored as standard unity textures, making them straightforward to read and set.

# Map Texture Packs

The vanilla game uses 4096x4096 sized map textures by default for grass, 2048x2048 for dirt and cliff though smaller scaled textures will successfully replace. For example, the example desert map theme pack uses 1024x1024 sized textures.
