# Map Texture Replacer

![Mod Window Opened](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cgameworld/ModListingImageStore/main/maptexturereplacer-preview.gif)

This mod allows you to easily replace grass, dirt and cliff map textures in your game.

The mod is intended to be used with map texture packs, go to the Map Texture Packs section to find packs on thunderstore to download. 

Features include:
- Dropdowns to easily change packs or individual textures
- Persistent settings between game loads
- Texture tiling adjustments
- Replacement of individual textures with any jpg/png from your computer 
- Map editor support  

This mod takes advantage of the fact that map textures are stored as standard unity textures, making them straightforward to read and set.
