This mod allows you to easily replace grass, dirt and cliff map textures in your game.

The mod is intended to be used with map texture packs, go to the Map Texture Packs section to find packs to download. 

Features include:
- Dropdowns to easily change packs or individual textures
- Persistent settings between game loads
- Texture tiling adjustments
- Replacement of individual textures with any jpg/png from your computer
