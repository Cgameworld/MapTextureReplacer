# Map Texture Replacer

This mod allows you to easily replace map textures in your game.

This mod takes advantage of the fact that map textures are stored as standard unity textures, making them straightfoward to read and set. 

Hopefully when the full offical editor releases, it will include map theming tools, but in the meantime this mod makes basic theming possible.

- HookUI
