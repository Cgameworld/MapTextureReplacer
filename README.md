![Mod Window Opened](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cgameworld/ModListingImageStore/main/maptexturereplacer-preview.gif)

This mod allows you to easily replace grass, dirt and cliff map textures in your game.

The mod is intended to be used with map texture packs, view this [modpack](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/p/Cgameworld/Map_Texture_Packs_Modpack/) for a list of all available map texture packs.

Features include:
- Dropdowns to easily change packs or individual textures
- Persistent settings between game loads
- Texture tiling adjustments
- Replacement of individual textures with any jpg/png from your computer
- Map editor support

This mod takes advantage of the fact that map textures are stored as standard unity textures, making them straightforward to read and set.
