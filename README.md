# Map Texture Replacer
This mod allows you to easily replace grass, dirt and cliff map textures in your game.

Features include:
- Dropdowns to easily change packs or individual textures
- Persistent settings between game loads
- Texture tiling adjustments
- Replacement of individual textures with any jpg/png from your computer
- Map editor support

This mod takes advantage of the fact that map textures are stored as standard unity textures, making them straightforward to read and set.
